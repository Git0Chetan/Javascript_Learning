        The interpreter ignores comments, but they are great as they leave information for us and other coders. The interpreter will ignore a single line after the // symbols. The interpreter will also ignore anything in between /* and */. Another use for JavaScript comments besides explaining the code and making it more readable is to also prevent code execution when you are testing alternative code. You can place single line codes above the code or at the end of the line to leave your explanation.
